This repo contains a few different examples of how we can annotate data with RDF triples using an ontology vocabulary

To see an example, run the scripts in src and examine how the input is formatted 
with annotations from the ontology. There will be two corresponding files corresponding to the serialization format: 
turtle and json-ld.
